                <h2>Signals analyst</h2>
                <p>I started my military career in Jacksonville, FL as a signals analyst. Quickly learning everything about
                     technology and the networks that related to my job, I knew i wanted to learn something more inside of
                      the IT realm. I started using my free time away from the watchfloor to study comptia exams and learn
                       anything i could online about network engineering with hopes of changing my career into a related role.</p>

                <h3>Network Engineer</h3>
                <p>After gaining certification and alot of self study, i got a new job in my new command at fort mead as a 
                    network engineer supporting a sigint mission. there i learned more about somputer networking and most 
                    importantly Data. I learned about how future proof a career ion data analytics could be and once again
                    decided to drop what i was doing and do something else instead. I took all the online courses i could to 
                    learn more about data analytics with a plan to leave the army and become an analyst.</p>

                <h4>Montana</h4>
                <p> I was born in missoula, a city outside of my hometown of saltese.
                    I occasionally travel back home to see family and take trips through the mountains and rivers of Montana.
                    My favorite hobby is hiking. I love being outside and experienceing the aesthetics of the world. sights 
                    sounds and smells that cant be recreated and leave the strongest memories.</p>

                <h5>Computer Network Operator</h5>
                <p>My plan didnt work out. I didnt have the experience necessary to land a job as a data analyst before leaving
                    the army, and i hadnt completed my degree. I got a job doing computer networking operations as a civillian
                    contrator however and that was great, what was better was i joined a course that would eventually offer me 
                    employment as a data scientist. I am currently still in the course pending graduation in march. </p>
